Bio:

My name is Rob Waltman, and I'm in my second quarter of the OSU
Ecampus Computer Science program.

I live in Arlington, VA, and hope to find a position among the
plentiful job market in the area once I've completed the program.

My hobbies are pretty disparate; I'm a former personal trainer
and long-time fitness enthusiast as well as an avid gamer of
both PC and tabletop games. I recently competed in the world
tournament for the Android: Netrunner collectible card game
and placed 29th overall.

I'm not sure yet as to which aspect of CS I would want to focus on
once I graduate; the field seems very diverse and I know so little
about the potential positions and what technologies they work with.
I'm hoping that the course will help me discover what aspects of
this very broad field would be best-suited for me.
