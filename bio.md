Bio:

My name is Rob Waltman, and I'm in my second quarter of the OSU
Ecampus Computer Science program.

I live in Arlington, VA, and hope to find a position among the
plentiful job market in the area once I've completed the program.

My hobbies are pretty disparate; I'm a former personal trainer
and long-time fitness enthusiast as well as an avid gamer of
both PC and tabletop games. I recently competed in the world
tournament for the Android: Netrunner collectible card game
and placed 29th overall.
