Bio:

My name is Rob Waltman, and I'm in my second quarter of the OSU
Ecampus Computer Science program.

I live in Arlington, VA, and hope to find a position among the
plentiful job market in the area once I've completed the program.

My hobbies are pretty disparate; I'm a former personal trainer
and long-time fitness enthusiast as well as an avid gamer of
both PC and tabletop games. I recently competed in the world
tournament for the Android: Netrunner collectible card game
and placed 29th overall.

I'm not sure yet as to which aspect of CS I would want to focus on
once I graduate; the field seems very diverse and I know so little
about the potential positions and what technologies they work with.
I'm hoping that the course will help me discover what aspects of
this very broad field would be best-suited for me.

I've always been curious about web development, as the business
world is seeing a trend of enterprise-level tools being moved to
cloud-based environments. Individual workstations are gradually
transitioning away from being unique working enviroments toward
being interchangable interfaces for the same set of web-based 
applications. Obviously there's a long way to go before anything
can unseat the MS Office suite, but several very influential and
talented companies are working on that exact thing!

Programming Background:

I've taken several programming courses in my past, and was fortunate
enough to attend a high school that offered an extensive technology
unit, offering electives like C++/Java programming, web development,
database development, and I even collaborated with a teacher to
develop the school's first game programming course.

I took the accelerated introduction to computer science last quarter
and found it quite enjoyable, my favorite project in that class was
the final project, for which I created a slot machine game.
